## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to Kevvy:

- **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please report it by opening an issue.
- **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Open an issue to discuss it.
- **Improving Documentation:** Help us make the documentation clearer and more comprehensive.
- **Writing Code:** Fix bugs or implement new features.
- **Adding Tests:** Improve test coverage for better stability.

## Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mauvehed/kevvy/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.

If you find a new bug, please provide a clear and concise report including:

- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- Expected behavior.
- Actual behavior.
- Screenshots (if applicable).
- Your environment details (e.g., OS, Python version, Docker version if used).

## Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features and improvements! Please open an issue to describe your suggestion, including:

- The problem your enhancement solves.
- A clear description of the proposed solution.
- Any potential alternatives you considered.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- **Git:** For version control.
- **Python:** Version 3.10 or higher.
- **uv:** The `uv` Python project manager. Install it following the [official uv documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation).
- **(Optional) Docker & Docker Compose:** If you plan to build or run the Docker image locally.
  - Note: A development image tagged as `:dev` may be available (e.g., `ghcr.io/mauvehed/kevvy:dev`). Check the project's container registry or `docker-compose.yml` for details on using development-specific images.

### Installation

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the [mauvehed/kevvy](https://github.com/mauvehed/kevvy) repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kevvy.git
    cd kevvy
    ```
3.  **Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:** Use `uv` to create a virtual environment and install project dependencies, including development dependencies.
    ```bash
    uv venv  # Create virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate
    uv pip install -e ".[dev]" # Install dependencies including dev extras
    ```
    This command creates a virtual environment in `.venv` and installs all required packages based on `pyproject.toml`.

### Configuration

1.  **Copy the Example Environment File:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  **Edit `.env`:** Fill in the necessary environment variables, especially `DISCORD_TOKEN` for running the bot locally. Refer to the main `README.md` for details on each variable.

### Running with Docker/Podman for Development (Using dev.sh)

If you have Docker or Podman installed along with `docker-compose` or `podman-compose`, the easiest way to run the bot for development, including automatic rebuilding and log viewing, is using the provided script:

```bash
./dev.sh
```

This script typically uses a development-specific compose file (like `docker-compose.dev.yml`) which might mount your local code into the container for live updates. It handles stopping old containers, building the new image (often tagged `:dev`), running the new container in the background, and then attaching to the logs (`logs -f`).

### Running Locally with uv

If you prefer not to use containers, you can run the bot directly using `uv` after completing the Installation and Configuration steps and activating your virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`):

```bash
python main.py
```

## Development Workflow

### Branching

When working on a specific GitHub Issue, please check if a branch has already been created for that issue (e.g., `issue/123-description`). If such a branch exists, please use it for your development work related to that ticket.

If no specific branch exists for the issue, create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you work on. Base your branch off the `main` branch. Use a descriptive name, e.g., `feat/add-new-command` or `fix/resolve-lookup-bug`.

```bash
# Example: Checking out a pre-existing issue branch
git fetch origin
git checkout issue/123-description

# Example: Creating a new branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main # Ensure your main branch is up-to-date
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory. Ensure all existing tests pass and add new tests for your changes.

- **Run all tests:** (Ensure your virtual environment is activated: `source .venv/bin/activate`)
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  uv run pytest
  ```

### Writing Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This helps automate changelog generation and makes commit history easier to understand.

Examples:

- `feat: add /cve latest command`
- `fix: correct assertion in test_channel_list_enabled`
- `docs: update README with new channel commands`
- `refactor: simplify embed creation logic`
- `test: add tests for verbose status command`
- `chore: update dependencies`

### Submitting Pull Requests

1.  Commit your changes following the commit message guidelines.
2.  Push your branch to your fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
3.  Open a Pull Request (PR) from your fork's branch to the `main` branch of the `mauvehed/kevvy` repository.
4.  Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the changes and linking to any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
5.  Ensure all automated checks (CI/CD, linting, tests) pass on your PR.
6.  Participate in the code review process, addressing any feedback.

## Project Structure Overview

- `kevvy/`: Contains the main bot source code.
  - `cogs/`: Houses the different command groups (Cogs).
  - `clients/`: (If applicable) API client implementations (e.g., `nvd_client.py`).
  - `bot.py`: The main `discord.Bot` subclass definition.
  - `db_utils.py`: Database interaction logic.
  - `cve_monitor.py`: Helper class for CVE processing.
  - ... (other core modules)
- `tests/`: Contains all automated tests (`pytest`).
- `docs/`: Project documentation source files (for `mkdocs`).
- `main.py`: The entry point for running the bot.
- `pyproject.toml`: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and tool configurations (Poetry, linters, etc.).
- `.env.example`: Example environment variable file.
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`: Docker configuration.
- `README.md`, `PRD.md`: High-level project information.
- `LICENSE`: Project license.

## Documentation

Documentation is important! If your changes affect user-facing features, commands, or configuration, please update the relevant documentation:

- `README.md`: For the main overview and usage examples.
- `PRD.md`: For the detailed command specification.
- `docs/`: For the `mkdocs` generated documentation site (especially files in `docs/commands/`).

To build and preview the documentation locally:
(Ensure your virtual environment is activated: `source .venv/bin/activate`)

```bash
# Assuming mkdocs is installed via development dependencies
mkdocs serve
```

or

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

## Getting Help

If you have questions about contributing or need help with your development setup, feel free to:
