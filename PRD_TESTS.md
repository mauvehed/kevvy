# PRD: Kevvy Test Coverage Enhancement

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2025-04-29

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements, plan, and design for significantly enhancing the automated test coverage of the Kevvy Discord bot. Robust test coverage is crucial for ensuring the bot's reliability, stability, maintainability, and for preventing regressions as new features are added or existing code is refactored.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this initiative are to:

- **Increase Code Coverage:** Achieve a target overall code coverage of **> 80%** as measured by `pytest-cov`.
- **Ensure Critical Path Reliability:** Guarantee that core functionalities like message processing (`on_message`), command handling, and background tasks (`check_cisa_kev_feed`, `send_stats_to_webapp`) are thoroughly tested under various conditions.
- **Validate Core Logic:** Verify the correctness of business logic related to CVE/KEV lookups, severity thresholds, verbosity settings, and data processing.
- **Test Integrations:** Ensure proper interaction between different components (Core Bot, Cogs, CVEMonitor, API Clients, Database).
- **Cover Edge Cases & Errors:** Test expected error handling paths, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions.
- **Boost Developer Confidence:** Enable developers to make changes and add features with higher confidence that they are not breaking existing functionality.
- **Improve Maintainability:** Well-tested code is easier and safer to refactor and maintain over time.

## 3. Existing Test Coverage (Summary)

The current test suite (`tests/`) provides a foundational level of coverage, primarily focused on unit/integration testing of specific components with external dependencies mocked:

- **KEV Command Cog (`cogs/kev_commands.py` - ~70%):** Tests cover the basic functionality of slash commands related to enabling, disabling, and setting the KEV feed channel (`/kev feed enable/disable/set`). Mocking is used for database interactions.
- **Database Utilities (`db_utils.py` - ~59%):** Core database operations, such as setting/getting KEV configurations, guild/channel CVE configurations, and retrieving seen KEVs, have reasonable test coverage. Tests likely use an in-memory SQLite database or mock cursor results.
- **CVE Monitor (`cve_monitor.py` - ~52%):** Key utility functions like `find_cves` (matching CVE patterns) and the basic structure generation of `create_cve_embed` and `create_kev_status_embed` (checking presence of core fields, title, color based on mocked data) are tested. External client calls are typically mocked.
- **CVE Lookup Cog (`cogs/cve_lookup.py` - ~28%):** The most basic success path for the `/cve lookup` command is likely covered, mocking the NVD client interaction.

While these tests are valuable, they primarily focus on isolated component logic and "happy path" scenarios.

## 4. Current State & Problem Definition (Coverage Gaps)

Despite the existing tests, a recent analysis using `pytest-cov` revealed an overall code coverage of approximately **30%**. This indicates significant gaps, particularly in integration points and core operational logic.

Key areas with low or non-existent coverage include:

- **Core Bot Logic (`kevvy/bot.py` - ~11%):** The main event loop (`on_message`), background task execution (`check_cisa_kev_feed`, `send_stats_to_webapp`), bot lifecycle events (`setup_hook`, `close`), statistic collection, caching logic, and error handling within these core functions are largely untested.
- **External API Clients (`kevvy/*_client.py` - ~11-20%):** The internal logic responsible for making HTTP requests, parsing responses (success and error), handling rate limits, and managing specific client state (like seen KEVs) is not adequately tested.
- **Complex Cog Logic (`kevvy/cogs/cve_lookup.py` - Remaining ~72%):** Beyond the basic lookup, complex filtering logic (`/cve latest`), channel/verbosity/threshold management subcommands, and the cog's own `on_message` handler lack sufficient testing.
- **Error Handling:** Many `try...except` blocks across the codebase, designed to handle specific errors (API errors, Discord errors, database errors), are not validated by tests.
- **Untested Modules:** `kevvy/cogs/diagnostics.py` (0%) and `kevvy/discord_log_handler.py` (~19%) have minimal or no coverage.

**Risks of Current State:**

- High likelihood of regressions going unnoticed.
- Potential for unexpected runtime failures in untested code paths.
- Increased difficulty and risk associated with refactoring or adding features.
- Reduced confidence in the stability and correctness of deployed versions.

## 5. Proposed Solution & Plan for Enhancement

We will adopt an iterative approach to improving test coverage, prioritizing the most critical and least-tested modules first. The primary tools will be `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-cov` (for measuring progress), and `pytest-mock` (or `unittest.mock`) for isolating components and simulating external dependencies (Discord API, HTTP APIs, Database).

**Testing Phases:**

1.  **Phase 1: Core Bot & Message Processing (`bot.py`):**
    - Focus on integration tests for the `on_message` handler, covering various scenarios (thresholds, verbosity, caching, errors).
    - Test the logic and error handling of background tasks (`check_cisa_kev_feed`, `send_stats_to_webapp`).
    - Validate statistic increments and core bot lifecycle methods.
2.  **Phase 2: API Clients & Complex Commands (`*_client.py`, `cogs/cve_lookup.py`):**
    - Write unit tests for the internal logic of each API client (requesting, parsing, error handling).
    - Add comprehensive tests for complex commands like `/cve latest` and the configuration management commands in `cve_lookup.py`.
3.  **Phase 3: Remaining Modules & Error Paths:**
    - Address specific missed lines identified by `pytest-cov` in moderately covered modules (`db_utils.py`, `cve_monitor.py`, `cogs/kev_commands.py`).
    - Add tests for currently uncovered modules (`cogs/diagnostics.py`, `discord_log_handler.py`).
    - Specifically target untested `try...except` blocks across the codebase.

## 6. Detailed Requirements & Scope for New/Enhanced Tests (By Module)

New and enhanced tests should be added to cover the following functionalities:

**6.1. `kevvy/bot.py` (Core Bot)**

- **`on_message` Handler:**
  - Messages with/without CVEs.
  - CVEs matching/failing severity thresholds.

## 7. Success Metrics

- **Primary:** Overall code coverage reported by `pytest --cov=kevvy` increases from ~30% to **> 80%**.
- **Secondary:** Coverage for critical modules (`bot.py`, `cogs/cve_lookup.py`, `nvd_client.py`, `cisa_kev_client.py`) reaches **> 80%**.
- CI builds incorporating coverage checks pass consistently.
- Qualitative: Observed reduction in regressions and unexpected runtime errors related to untested areas.

## 8. Open Issues / Future Considerations

- Testing true concurrency and potential race conditions remains challenging with standard unit/integration tests.
- Consideration of adding end-to-end tests using a dedicated test bot instance (potentially out of scope for this initial push).
- Integrating coverage thresholds into the CI pipeline to automatically fail builds if coverage drops below the target.
- **NVD Client Test Mocking:** The tests for `nvd_client.py` (in `tests/test_nvd_client_*.py`) are currently skipped (`@pytest.mark.skip`). There were persistent issues (`TypeError: 'coroutine' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol`) encountered while trying to mock `aiohttp.ClientSession.get` using both standard mocking techniques and the `pytest-aiohttp` plugin. These tests need to be revisited and fixed in the future to ensure the NVD client logic is fully validated.
