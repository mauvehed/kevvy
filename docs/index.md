# Welcome to Kevvy Bot Documentation

**kevvy** is a Discord bot designed to help you stay informed about software vulnerabilities.

Key features include:

- **Automatic CVE Detection:** Identifies CVE IDs in chat messages and provides details.
- **Direct CVE Lookup:** `/cve lookup` command for specific vulnerability details.
- **CISA KEV Monitoring:** Optional alerts for new additions to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.
- **Configurable Alerts:** Control alert channels and verbosity using slash commands.

For a full overview, installation instructions, and contribution guidelines, please see the main [README.md file on GitHub](https://github.com/mauvehed/kevvy/blob/main/README.md).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with the bot is to simply invite it to your Discord and away you go!

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (Recommended for running)
- OR **Python 3.10+** and **uv** (the `uv` Python project manager, for local development/running)
- A **Discord Bot Token**. You can create a bot and get a token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Configuration

The bot is configured using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, edit the `.env` file:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` (Required): Your Discord bot token.
- `NVD_API_KEY` (Optional): Your NVD API key. Request one [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key) for significantly higher request rate limits. Used as the primary data source for CVE details.
- `VULNCHECK_API_TOKEN` (Optional): Your VulnCheck API key. _(Note: This is planned for future integration as a potential primary data source but is not currently used by the core CVE lookup commands)._ Get one from [VulnCheck](https://vulncheck.com/).
- `DISCORD_COMMAND_PREFIX` (Optional): The prefix for traditional commands (if any are added later). Defaults to `!`. The primary interaction is automatic detection and slash commands.
- `LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID` (Optional): The ID of the Discord channel to which log messages should be sent.
- `DISABLE_DISCORD_LOGGING` (Optional): Set to `true` to disable sending logs to the Discord channel specified by `LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID`. Defaults to `false`.

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Make sure you have configured your `.env` file (especially `DISCORD_TOKEN`).
3.  Start the bot container in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    _(This will automatically pull the `ghcr.io/mauvehed/kevvy:latest` image if you don't have it locally)._
4.  **View Logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f kevvy-bot
    ```
5.  **Stop Container:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Running Locally with uv

1.  Ensure Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) are installed.
2.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mauvehed/kevvy.git && cd kevvy`
3.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  Install bot dependencies (including development dependencies):
    ```bash
    uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```
5.  Configure your `.env` file.
6.  Run the bot:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
