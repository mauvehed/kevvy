# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The **preferred method** for reporting vulnerabilities in **kevvy** is via **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting feature**.

This allows for direct, private communication with the maintainers and helps track the disclosure process effectively.

**To report a vulnerability:**

1.  Navigate to the main page of the [kevvy repository](https://github.com/mauvehed/kevvy).
2.  Click on the **Security** tab (located under the repository name).
3.  Click on **Report a vulnerability**.
4.  Fill out the form with as much detail as possible, including:
    - A clear description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the behavior.
    - A proof of concept (if applicable).
5.  Submit the report.

We will evaluate the vulnerability report submitted via GitHub and communicate through the GitHub Security Advisory platform. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing security issues.

Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed through the private reporting process.

(The previous email-based reporting method is superseded by GitHub's integrated feature.)
