## Enhancements to Existing Command Groups

**1. `on_message` Automatic Scanning & Alerting:**
_ **Per-Channel Severity Thresholds:** Your PRD mentions this as a future consideration for `on_message` alerts. This would offer much greater flexibility, allowing high-traffic channels to have stricter thresholds (e.g., only "critical") while more focused security channels could see "medium" and above. This would be a high-impact improvement.
_ **Role Tagging for Alerts:** Allow configuration (perhaps per-channel or tied to the severity threshold) to tag a specific Discord role when an `on_message` alert is triggered, ensuring the right people are notified immediately.
_ **Alert Debouncing/Summarizing:** If multiple CVEs are posted in rapid succession in a monitored channel, the bot could consolidate these into a single summary message after a short delay to prevent chat spam.
_ **Contextual Notification for KEV/KEVIntel Updates:** If a CVE detected by `on_message` is later added to the CISA KEV or KEVIntel catalog, the bot could provide an update notification, possibly as a reply to its original alert message if feasible, or in a designated "updates" channel.

**2. `/cve lookup <cve_id>`:**
_ **Expanded Data Sources:** Include links or summaries from other relevant sources like Exploit-DB, vendor advisories, or even links to specific GitHub repositories known to contain PoCs for the CVE.
_ **Direct CISA KEV Link:** If the CVE is in the CISA KEV catalog, provide a direct link to its entry on the CISA website.

**3. `/cve latest`:**
_ **Implement Advanced Filtering:** Prioritize implementing the "More advanced filtering" mentioned in the PRD (vendor, product, vulnerability type, exploit status). Additionally, consider filtering by CWE.
_ **Saved Filter Presets:** Allow users to save and name common filter combinations for `/cve latest` (e.g., `/cve latest preset critical_microsoft`). \* **Digest Mode:** Offer an option for a "digest" mode, where `/cve latest` results (based on saved presets or new criteria) are sent as a scheduled summary (e.g., daily/weekly) to a designated channel, rather than just on-demand.

**4. `/verbose` Command Group:**
* **Test Verbosity Command:** Add a subcommand like `/verbose test <example_cve_id>` that doesn't perform live lookups but shows how an alert for that CVE *would\* be formatted (standard vs. verbose) based on the current global and relevant channel settings. This helps admins confirm their configurations without waiting for a real CVE to be mentioned.

**5. `/kev latest` & `/kevintel latest`:**
_ **Implement Enhanced Filtering:** Prioritize the PRD's suggested "Enhanced filtering (severity - requires mapping CVE severity to KEV entry, ransomware use)." Also, add filtering by "due date" proximity for CISA KEV entries (e.g., "due in next 7 days").
_ **Feed Filtering:** For the `/kev feed enable` and `/kevintel feed enable` commands, allow specifying filters (e.g., vendor, product) so that the feed channel only receives alerts for new KEV/KEVIntel entries matching those criteria. \* **Dedicated Lookup Commands:** Consider adding `/kev lookup <cve_id>` and `/kevintel lookup <cve_id>` to specifically check if a single CVE is present in these respective catalogs and display its KEV/KEVIntel details. While `/cve lookup` includes this, dedicated commands could be useful for focused workflows.

**6. `/cve format` (Future Feature mentioned in PRD):**
_ **Customization Options:** When implementing, consider allowing users to:
_ Reorder fields in the embed.
_ Add custom static text to the header or footer of alerts.
_ Define if certain fields are always shown/hidden, overriding verbosity for those specific fields. \* Potentially, an option for a compact text-only format (non-embed) for certain channels.

## User Experience (UX) & Usability Improvements

- **Comprehensive Help Command:** A global `/kevvy help [command_group]` command that dynamically lists available commands and subcommands with brief descriptions. For example, `/kevvy help cve channel` would detail the subcommands under `/cve channel`.
- **Centralized Settings Overview:** A command like `/kevvy settings view [module: cve|kev|kevintel|all]` to display all current configurations for the server in a readable format (global settings, channel overrides, feed configurations, thresholds, verbosity, etc.).
- **Interactive Configuration:** For managing channel configurations, verbosity, and thresholds, consider using Discord's interactive components (buttons, select menus) where appropriate. This can be more user-friendly than requiring users to type out channel names or specific "True/False" values. For example, `/cve channel add` could present a dropdown of server channels.
- **Improved Pagination:** For commands that list multiple CVEs/KEVs (like `/cve latest`, `/kev latest`), implement proper pagination (e.g., with "Next" / "Previous" buttons) if the result set exceeds the per-message display limit, rather than just capping at 10 items.
- **Visual Cues in Embeds:** Enhance embeds with more visual cues, such as color-coding severity levels (e.g., red for critical, orange for high).
- **Action Buttons on Embeds:** For `on_message` alerts or lookup results, consider adding buttons to embeds for common follow-up actions like:
  - `More Info from NVD` (links to NVD)
  - `Check Exploit-DB`
  - `Add to Watchlist` (if a watchlist feature is implemented)
  - `Acknowledge` (if basic tracking is implemented)

## New Feature Modules

These are larger new areas of functionality.

- **CVE/KEV Watchlists:**
  - Commands: `/watchlist add <cve_id> [reason]`, `/watchlist remove <cve_id>`, `/watchlist list [channel_to_notify]`.
  - Functionality: Users can add specific CVEs to a server-wide (or potentially user-specific) watchlist. The bot would then monitor these CVEs and provide notifications in a designated channel (or DM to the user) if their status changes (e.g., added to KEV/KEVIntel, a public exploit is published, CVSS score changes, vendor patch released).
- **Vendor/Product Specific Subscriptions:**
  - Commands: `/subscribe product <vendor_name> <product_name> <channel> [min_severity]`, `/subscribe list`, `/subscribe remove <subscription_id>`.
  - Functionality: Allows a server to subscribe to notifications for new CVEs or KEV entries affecting specific vendors or products they heavily rely on. Alerts would be posted to the configured channel.
- **Automated Reporting/Digests:**
  - Commands: `/report schedule <type:cve|kev> <frequency:daily|weekly> <channel> [filters]`, `/report generate_now <type> [filters]`.
  - Functionality: Generate and send periodic summaries (e.g., weekly digest of new "critical" CVEs, or new KEVs added) to a specified channel. Filters could be similar to the `latest` commands.
- **Basic Threat Actor Association (Informational):**
  - When displaying CVE details (especially in verbose mode or lookup), if reliable public information links a CVE to known threat actors or campaigns, mention this association with a source. This would likely involve integrating another data source.

## Administrative & Backend Improvements

- **Enhanced Audit Logging:** Expand the existing logging tables (or create new ones) to include a clear audit trail for all configuration changes made via commands (e.g., who changed a channel's verbosity, enabled/disabled a feed, set a threshold, and when).
  - Command: `/kevvy admin logview [filters]` for authorized users to view these logs.
- **Configuration Import/Export:** For server administrators, provide commands to export the bot's current configuration for that server (channel settings, feeds, thresholds, etc.) to a file (e.g., JSON), and to import such a file to quickly set up another server or restore a configuration.
- **System Health/Debug Command:**
  - `/kevvy admin status` or `/kevvy debug`
  - Functionality: For server admins to check:
    - Bot's ability to connect to external APIs (NVD, CISA KEV, KEVIntel).
    - Database connectivity.
    - Basic permissions checks in the current channel/server.
    - Rate limit status with external APIs (if APIs provide such headers).
