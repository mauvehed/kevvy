## About

**kevvy** is a Discord bot with the following main functions:

1.  **Automatic CVE Detection:** It automatically monitors chat messages for CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifiers (e.g., `CVE-2023-12345`). When a CVE is detected, the bot fetches detailed information primarily from the [VulnCheck API](https://vulncheck.com/) (if an API key is provided). If VulnCheck is unavailable or doesn't return data, it falls back to the [NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API v2.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities).
2.  **Direct CVE Lookup:** Users can explicitly request details for a specific CVE using the `/cve lookup` command.
3.  **CISA KEV Monitoring:** Optionally monitors the [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) and sends alerts for new entries to configured channels.

Key features:
*   Automatic detection of CVE IDs in messages.
*   Direct lookup of specific CVEs via `/cve lookup`.
*   Fetches details primarily from VulnCheck (if available), falling back to NVD.
*   Displays CVSS score (v3.1/v3.0/v2.0), vector string, description, publication dates, CWEs, and reference links.
*   Consolidates responses for messages containing multiple CVEs (max 5 embeds per message by default) to prevent spam.
*   Optionally checks the CISA KEV catalog periodically and posts alerts for new entries to a designated channel (configurable per server).

## Usage

1.  **Invite the Bot:** Invite the configured bot to your Discord server.
2.  **Automatic Detection:** Simply type or paste a message containing one or more CVE IDs (e.g., `Check out CVE-2024-1234 and CVE-2024-5678`). The bot will automatically detect them and post embed(s) with the details.
    *   If multiple unique CVEs are in one message, the bot will post details for up to 5 of them (by default) and indicate if more were found.
3.  **Direct Lookup:** Use the slash command `/cve lookup cve_id:<CVE-ID>` (e.g., `/cve lookup cve_id:CVE-2024-0001`) to get details for a specific vulnerability.
4.  **CISA KEV Alerts (Optional Setup):**
    *   `/kev enable channel:<#your-alert-channel>`: A server administrator with 'Manage Server' permissions can run this command to enable KEV monitoring and designate a specific channel for alerts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (Recommended for running)
*   OR **Python 3.10+** and **Poetry** (For local development/running)
*   A **Discord Bot Token**. You can create a bot and get a token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Configuration

The bot is configured using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, edit the `.env` file:

*   `DISCORD_TOKEN` (Required): Your Discord bot token.
*   `NVD_API_KEY` (Optional): Your NVD API key. Request one [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key) for significantly higher request rate limits. Used as a fallback data source if VulnCheck is unavailable or fails.
*   `VULNCHECK_API_TOKEN` (Optional): Your VulnCheck API key. Get one from [VulnCheck](https://vulncheck.com/). If provided, VulnCheck becomes the *primary* data source for CVE details.
*   `DISCORD_COMMAND_PREFIX` (Optional): The prefix for traditional commands (if any are added later). Defaults to `!`. The primary interaction is automatic detection and slash commands.
*   `LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID` (Optional): The ID of the Discord channel to which log messages should be sent.
*   `DISABLE_DISCORD_LOGGING` (Optional): Set to `true` to disable sending logs to the Discord channel specified by `LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID`. Defaults to `false`.

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Make sure you have configured your `.env` file (especially `DISCORD_TOKEN`).
3.  Start the bot container in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    _(This will automatically pull the `ghcr.io/mauvehed/kevvy:latest` image if you don't have it locally)._
4.  **View Logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f kevvy-bot
    ```
5.  **Stop Container:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Running Locally with Poetry

1.  Ensure Python 3.10+ and Poetry are installed.
2.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mauvehed/kevvy.git && cd kevvy`
3.  Install bot dependencies: `poetry install`
4.  Configure your `.env` file.
5.  Run the bot: `poetry run python main.py`
